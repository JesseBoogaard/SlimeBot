As a tradeoff, they do not have a favorite food."

With their perky ears, striped backs, and swaying tails, you'd almost mistake them for a true feline... \n If they weren't made entirely of gooey slime, of course. \n A Tabby slime generally doesn't mean any harm to a rancher, but like their spiritual Earth cat cousins, often causes a great deal of chaos anyway. Tabby slimes love to steal things they don't eat, like fruits and veggies, resulting in lots of unintended largo transformations on the Range."
