# SlimeBot

## what is it

**SlimeBot** is a text-based adaption (disguised as a Discord bot) of the indie-game SlimeRancher, it kind of doubles as a SlimeRancher wiki too.

For this project I used [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) (an awesome wrapper for the [Discord API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/intro)) along with [Google Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/) (as replacement of SQLite).
